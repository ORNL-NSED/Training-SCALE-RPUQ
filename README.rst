SCALE Training: RP UQ
=====================

The purpose of this repository is to manage the inputs and outputs for the SCALE Reactor Physics (RP) Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) training course which teaches both TSUNAMI and SAMPLER with a focus on applications in reactor physics such as depletion and few-group cross section generation.

Here are the materials distributed by course.
