SCALE Training: RP UQ
=====================

The purpose of this repository is to manage the inputs and outputs for the SCALE Reactor Physics (RP) Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) training course which teaches both TSUNAMI and SAMPLER with a focus on applications in reactor physics such as depletion and few-group cross section generation.

Here are the materials distributed by course.

- 2017 M&C Workshop "Uncertainty Quantification in SCALE 6.2 for Depletion and Decay problems": April 16 in Jeju, Korea:  [`2017MnC <https://github.com/ORNL-NSED/Training-SCALE-RPUQ/releases/tag/2017MnC>`_]
- 2017 OECD/NEA March 12-17 in Paris, France [`2017NEA <https://github.com/wawiesel/Training-SCALE-RPUQ/releases/tag/2017NEA>`_]

Here are additional tricks that are necessary for certain versions of SCALE.

- how to get TRITON to use perturbed decay libraries [`6.2.1 <https://github.com/wawiesel/Training-SCALE-RPUQ/tree/master/src/Sampler/resources/tricks/6.2.1/tdepl_decay_uncertainty>`_]
